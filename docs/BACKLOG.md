## Later (Potential improvements - Not to be implemented right now)
- Later can add slash commands in the bot to send various kinds of messages 
  - The slash commands can be used to tag the various type of notes 
  - The slash commands can be used to ask 
- Trudy can also proactively send messages back to the user on what he has done. This should be ignored while downloadin
- More scripts can be added to post post process these notes and generate insights. 
  - These insights can be used to generate reports and develop audiences. 

(Move this to the overall vision of trudy in other repository)
